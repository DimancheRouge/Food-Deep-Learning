# Food-Deep-Learning

## Quickstart
1) Download repository; ensure that you have Python-Files (which contains FoodMain.py, DLFood.py, Reference.py), test.rar, train.rar, and requirements.txt
2) Extract test.rar and train.rar; ensure that all files/folders are in the same directory
3) Download project dependencies via requirements.txt with the command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4) Run FoodMain.py

## Notes
* Requirements.txt is poorly optimized, I reused an old file that uses most of the same packages
* May contain unexpected bugs/crashes; didn't QA much, so don't do anything too crazy
* Feel free to report issues, I'll try to address them as best I can
